Space was provided by Food Corporation of India through their godown. From a humble beginning of just 30 students in Civil Engineering branch, the Institute has progressed to six branches with total intake of 280 students per year. <br />
          <span class="flt rp_weltxt2"> The Institute was opened in rural area of Chandrapur District with the aim of imparting technical education to the students from rural background who are otherwise deprived of quality technical education. And the Institute has been extremely successful in bringing the students from village setup in to the main stream of nation's progress. With each passing year the Institute has developed into an ideal teaching temple where the faculty members are dedicated towards their job and feel proud when their students pass out with flying colors. </span><br />
